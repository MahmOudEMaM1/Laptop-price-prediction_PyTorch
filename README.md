# Laptop Price Prediction with PyTorch

## Objective  
This project predicts laptop prices using machine learning. The model is built with PyTorch and uses laptop features like brand, CPU, RAM, and more to predict the price.

## Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **PyTorch** (for building the model)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for data preprocessing and evaluation)  
- **Pandas** (for handling the dataset)  
- **NumPy** (for data manipulation)

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Categorical data is encoded, and numerical data is scaled using Scikit-learn.
  - Data is split into training and testing sets.
